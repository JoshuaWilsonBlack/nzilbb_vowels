Description: A collection of tools to support research on vocalic covariation, 
    especially research using Principal Component Analysis. Functions are 
    provided to test whether PCA is appropriate, to determine how many PCs to 
    report, and to choose which loadings to focus on in interpretation. Plotting 
    functions are also provided to display PCA results in the vowel space. 
    Datasets are also provided from recent work at the New Zealand Institute of 
    Language, Brain and Behaviour.
