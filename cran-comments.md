## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Rewritten the description field in the DESCRIPTION file to include references
and shorten.
* Removed redundant "Functions and Data for" from start of the title.
* Added \value to plot_pc_input.Rd and summary.correlation_test.Rd.
* Removed if(interactive()) from the example in mds_test.Rd. 
* Changed the arguments to mds_test() in the example in mds_test.Rd so that it 
runs more quickly.

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.
