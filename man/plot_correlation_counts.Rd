\title{Plot of correlation counts from \code{correlation_test} object}
\usage{
plot_correlation_counts(cor_test, alpha = 0.05, half_violin = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{cor_test}{an object of class \code{correlation_test} generated by
\code{correlation_test}.}

\item{alpha}{significance level for counting correlation as significant.}

\item{half_violin}{Plot correlation counts using a half violin plot and half
point plot. Quantiles are not currently supported.}
}
\value{
\code{ggplot} object.
}
\description{
Plot the number of statistically significant pairwise correlations in a data
set given an alpha value against the distribution of counts of statistically
significant pairwise correlations in permuted data. This is an informal test
which is useful to convincing yourself that there is structure in your data
which PCA might be able to uncover.
}
\details{
The resulting plot presents the distribution of \emph{counts} of statistically
significant correlations at a given alpha level in the permuted data and the
count of statistically significant correlations in the original data. If the
red dot is above the uppermost line inside the blue violin plot, we say the
number of statistically significant correlations in the real data is itself
statistically significant. Usually this is used as a rough sanity check in
the course of a PCA workflow and we want to see the red dot well above the
violin (as in the example below).

The resulting plot is a \code{ggplot2} plot and can be modified using functions
from that package. For instance, titles can be removed using the \code{\link[ggplot2:labs]{ggplot2::labs()}}
function (as in the examples below).
